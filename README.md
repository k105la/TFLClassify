# TFLClassify

This app runs a Tensorflow model that is trained to recognize 964 bird species from images. It is based on MobileNet, and trained on photos contributed by the iNaturalist community.

The species and images are a subset of the iNaturalist 2017 Competition dataset, organized by Visipedia. This model was originally published as part of the Natural Explorer module for Google's AIY Vision Kit.
